<h2>My name is Claire Martin,</h2>
<p>I am a Scotland-based software engineer/UX designer. A recent CodeClan grad, I'm looking for opportunities to work on innovative projects and to continue growing my knowledge of software.</p>

<p>In my spare time I enjoy hillwaking, baking, and mucking about with code (so you may see this space change frequently).</p>

<p>If you're interested in my work or finding out more about me, send me a message over on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/claire-e-martin/">LinkedIn</a>!</p>

<p>Claire :) </p>
