<h1>Hi, I'm Claire!</h1>
<p>I'm a Scotland-based software engineer/UX designer. A recent CodeClan grad, I'm looking for opportunities to work on innovative projects and to continue growing my knowledge of software.</p> 

<p>In my spare time I enjoy hillwaking, baking, and mucking about with code (so you may see this space change frequently).</p>

<p>If you're interested in my work or finding out more about me, please send me a message over on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/claire-e-martin/">LinkedIn</a>!</p>

    <h4><a href="https://github.com/cemmartin/python_project">Hopsitality Order Management App</h4>
    <p>This order management app was inspired by my experience working in a bakery/cafe during the peak of the pandemic. It was designed with my employer and many of the pitfalls we faced in mind, however it can easily be used by any similar establishment.</p>
